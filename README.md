**`Aspiring Software Engineer` :computer:**

I'm Zsombor Töreky, a hungarian Computer Science Student. 
I'm mostly focusing on becoming a backend developer.
I've worked on various projects, counting python automization tasks, backend focused application using java spring and even worked with AR (Hololens 1, Unity), creating a CT viewing application, planning to be tested and used in medicine.
I fluently write and speak in english (C1 language certificate) and I have a passive German knowledge (B2 language certificate).
New opportunities are always welcome :grin:
